# Recipe Organizer Project for CS100
Team: Shirya Gore, Joshua Ha, Prashast Pandey, Stella Park, Aarav Vanamareddy

Creating a recipe manager project is not only interesting but important to us as it allows us to organize recipes to be accessed efficiently for cooking.
We plan on using the programming languages C++ and Javascript for backend. Our project will allow the user to log in to our website. Once they have logged in, they are able to access their custom recipes or other recipes produced by other users.
